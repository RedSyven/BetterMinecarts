Vanilla minecart acceleration is still retained. 

Minecarts will only gain improved acceleration on flat, straight powered/normal rails, and if the supporting block is either a Redstone Block, Smooth Stone Block, Smooth Stone Slab or Quartz Block.

These blocks can be configured under `BetterMinecarts/data/betterminecarts/tags/blocks/boost.json`
